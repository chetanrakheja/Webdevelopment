this repo contain the copy of edx site home pg copy 


note-

this is not fully functional,
made only for learning webpage designing,
it does not cover all the things,
tried to minimize local file by using website img address instead of ofline imgs(using website img src so will not work if net is not working properly),
used bootstrap

what all I was able to done:-
was able to make dropdown correctly
made proper footer
was able to make navbar correctly
able to create favicon(done first time)

what all I was not able to done correctly :-
Styling dropdown correctly(was not able to define position of dropdown , it is starting below the dropdown item ,not from custom position)
not able to create crousal properly so removed it (Containing anme of many universities)
not able to create search button inside the input bar
not able to style background img properly

i have not worked on reponsiveness of the web page
